<p><span class="smcap">Industrial</span> schools, in which poor children, the
waifs of the streets, are fed, lodged, and taught
some useful employment, have been in existence
for more than thirty years, and are on all hands
acknowledged to have been successful as a means
of preventing&mdash;or lessening the amount of&mdash;juvenile
crime and vagrancy. The weak point in the
organisation of these schools is that they rely for
support on the voluntary contributions of benevolent
individuals, instead of forming part of the
poor-law system, and being thereby maintained
by the whole taxable community. Some will
think there is a more serious drawback in their
constitution. By whatever name these schools
are known, they are in effect asylums for the
grouping of children to the number of several
hundreds in a large establishment; and so far
are a repetition of the old species of hospitals,
which are now generally condemned. On a late
occasion we brought under the notice of our
readers a method of boarding-out pauper children
among the families of rural labourers and small
tradesmen in country towns, which has proved
eminently successful wherever it has been tried
in Scotland. As this method of boarding-out is
under the administration of parochial boards relying
on rates, it has, with other merits, that of
not specially taxing the benevolence of particular
individuals.</p>

<p>What we peculiarly admired in the boarding-out
system was its conservation of the family-home
as a means of juvenile nurture and intellectual
and moral culture. We now propose to give
some account of a family-home system which has
been established in England. It differs materially
from that prevalent in Scotland, and further
labours under the objection of being a voluntary
charity similar to that of the Industrial schools.
Though not quite to our mind, it is much better
than nothing, and we bespeak for it the kindly
attention of the public.</p>

<p>This English 'Village Home' system originated
in the efforts of Dr Bernardo, who began with a
'Home' for Arab and gutter boys in London. No
sooner was this Home in operation than he set
about founding a similar establishment for girls,
in which good work he was ably assisted by his
wife. 'The Village Home' at Ilford in Essex,
for orphan, neglected, and destitute girls is the
result.</p>

<p>Little girls up to the age of eleven or twelve
are rescued weekly from misery and danger and
placed under the care of a Mother. Even babies
of only twelve and fifteen months are admitted,
in cases where the detective, employed by Dr
Bernardo to find out wretched and abandoned
children, learns that the child will be brought up
by a 'tramp' to a life of infamy. Before a girl
thus rescued is permitted to join the family of
which she is to become a member, she is carefully
tended for several weeks in a Home in
London, in order that her freedom from disease
and her personal cleanliness may be secure; after
which she is sent down to Ilford, and becomes at
once a member of a <i>family</i>, with a dozen other
girls of varying ages for playmates and sisters.
The Mother gives her a kiss, and tells her to be a
good girl, and they will all love her dearly; and
in a few days the forlorn little one is transformed
into something human and child-like. In order
to become acquainted with the internal organisation
of this 'Home' training of large numbers of
destitute children gathered together from all parts
of London, we recently visited Dr Bernardo's 'Village
Home' at Ilford, the third and most recently
founded establishment of the kind. Thither we
repair, and find that the pretty red cottages
which compose the Village form an oblong
square, which surrounds a large open space of
ground, intended hereafter to inclose a piece of
grass of sufficient size for the grazing of a few
sheep. A picturesque gateway admits the visitor
to the governor's house, which is built in the
same style as the cottages. We were met at the
entrance by the governor.</p>

<p>'The children are all in school now,' said he;
'what do you say to going there first, and then
you will see them all together?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">{434}</a></span></p>

<p>During a walk of some five or six minutes, past
a dozen cottages and through two or three turnstile
gates, we met on our road half-a-dozen
happy-faced little children minding babies younger
than themselves. The school-rooms occupy a long
detached building. We entered one, a large cheerful
room furnished with desks and forms, and
hung with maps, pictures of animals, and illustrated
texts of Scripture and homely proverbs.</p>

<p>The girls regarded us with bright cheerful
curiosity. There was no stolid indifference or
sullen discontent expressed in any of their faces.
They stood up as the governor took off his hat,
and each one dropped us a quick little courtesy and
smiled pleasantly as we passed by her desk. The
ages of the children in this room varied from
perhaps ten to fourteen or fifteen; and we observed
that their hair was not cropped, that it was braided
close to the head, according to the fancy of the
owner, where it was long; and that those who had
it short wore either a round comb or piece of dark
ribbon to keep it from falling over their eyes.</p>

<p>On our remarking to the governor that this in
itself was a great improvement on the usual habit
of keeping the hair cropped, he replied: 'We do
all we can to develop nice womanly habits in the
older girls, so we make it a rule <i>never</i> to cut their
hair, so long as they keep it clean and tidy; and
we find the plan succeeds very well, each girl
knowing the penalty she will have to pay for
slovenliness in this respect; and as you see for
yourself, they take care to keep their locks.' The
girls are not dressed in uniform, which we consider
to be advantageous.</p>

<p>A pleasant-faced schoolmistress presided over
this room. The hours perhaps are a little longer
than is absolutely necessary; but still, although
morning lessons were just over, we searched in vain
for one over-tired listless face. All the children
looked happy and bright and clean, and most of
them were so healthy in appearance that it was a
real pleasure to watch them eagerly putting away
their slates preparatory to scampering back to
their various homes.</p>

<p>The school-room education is sound and practical,
and suited to the position the girls will occupy on
leaving the Village.</p>

<p>An animated scene met our view as we turned
into the square around which stand the various
Homes. About a hundred girls, from fourteen
years old down to babies only just able to toddle,
were laughing and chatting merrily as they hurried
along the broad pathway, and gathered in clusters
in front of each cottage, glancing shyly at the
visitors walking behind ere they disappeared indoors
like bees returning to their hives.</p>

<p>We entered the first Home; and as they are
all alike in form and arrangement, a description of
one will suffice for all. They are of red brick,
detached, and of Gothic style, containing day-room
kitchen, scullery, and pantry on the ground-floor,
besides a tiny private sitting-room for the Mother.
The sleeping apartments are up-stairs, five in
number; four for the little family, and one small
one for the Mother.</p>

<p>From half-past twelve to one is dinner-hour, so
we arrived just in time to see the meal served.
Each cottage is presided over by a woman carefully
selected for the post she has to fill, capable of both
firmness and gentleness, of an affectionate disposition,
and accustomed to manage children. She is
called Mother by the little ones under her care;
her will is law; all in her cottage obey it; or if not,
are treated as naughty children would be in homes
of their own. The various arrangements of the
household are made clear to each inmate, and the
conscientious carrying out of them is inculcated on
each member of the family for the comfort and
well-being of all. The cottages are large enough
to hold twenty girls, five in each bedroom; but
when we were there, none of the cottages contained
more than fifteen or sixteen.</p>

<p>The rooms in which the girls sleep are plain and
homelike. Small iron bedsteads painted green,
and covered with a counterpane bearing the name
of the Village, woven in the centre, occupy the
corners; a washing-stand with basin and jug and
soap-dish of simple ware, is placed on one side, to
enable the girls to learn to use and lift such breakable
articles without fear or awkwardness; combs
and brushes are kept in a drawer, and a square
looking-glass hangs on the wall, that there may
not be any excuse for untidy appearance.</p>

<p>Nothing is done in the Home by forced routine.
The older girls take it in turn to help to cook the
dinner, to lay the cloth, to keep the house in
order, and to imitate Mother in everything she
does. Each small domestic duty is performed over
and over again, till each child learns to be quite an
adept at cooking potatoes, or cleaning out a room,
or washing and dressing a younger one; and takes
a pride in her work, so as to be able to do it <i>as
well as Mother</i>. The child is daily and hourly accustomed
to perform small services for the household,
to keep down her temper, to give sympathy and
willing aid to those who have not been so long in
the Home as herself, and to do all she can to help
Mother; hence, when she enters service, she has
already learnt in her Home to do thoroughly all
the commonplace duties which are likely to fall to
her lot as a servant. In these Homes every girl
has a motive for which to work; she is taught
to love truth, to be gentle and modest, and to
give and accept the affection to which all have an
equal right from Mother down to the youngest
in the house. Family interest is encouraged in
every cottage; the girls are taught to regard each
other as adopted sisters; individuality of character
is carefully studied by the head of the household,
and as far as lies in her power, is trained into usefulness
for the benefit of the whole community.</p>

<p>Every day, in each household one or two stay
from school for an hour or so, in order to learn
the art of cooking the simple dinner partaken by
their sisters when they come home. The table is
carefully laid; every article in the kitchen is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">{435}</a></span>
scrupulously cleaned; the rice, if it be rice-day,
duly weighed, washed, boiled, and constantly
watched by the eager pair of eyes whose duty it is
to see that it does not burn; and then, when all,
with clean hands and faces, are seated round the
table, the little cook of the day has to carry the
plates full of rice to Mother, to add the treacle or
sugar allowed, according to the wish of each child.</p>

<p>The furniture of the cottage throughout is solid
and plain, and of a kind that can be kept clean by
scrubbing. The children amuse themselves in the
room in which they dine; at one end of which
are shelves divided into pigeon-holes, in which
each girl may keep her work and small treasures.
These pigeon-holes are left unclosed, to teach the
children to resist the temptation of touching a
sister's things without leave. In this room they
play, work, mend their clothes, darn their stockings,
and talk to Mother, who sits with them for the
greater part of the evening. She has her own
private parlour at the side, from whence she can
command a view of the kitchen and scullery and
see that all goes on well there; and at the same
time she can hear, without being seen, the conversation
that takes place between her children
and any relative who is permitted to visit them;
an arrangement which often avoids harm from
injudicious influence.</p>

<p>One of the special duties of the Mother is to
inculcate habits of domestic comfort in a home on
a small scale, and so to cultivate the powers of
contrivance of each girl as to obtain the greatest
possible amount of household pleasure for all.</p>

<p>Each girl's clothes are kept on a shelf in a press;
the elder ones superintend mending operations, and
the tidiness of the younger ones. There is <i>no number</i>
marked on their things, not even on the shoes
and boots, which are kept beautifully clean and
ready for use in a recess at the foot of the press.</p>

<p>Everything about the cottage bears the stamp
of ordinary home-life; nothing is institutionised.
Every natural social feeling is fostered and developed
in this Home life, so that when the time
arrives for a girl to go into service, she carries with
her into her new home not only a practical knowledge
of the duties expected of her, which fits her
to hold her own among her fellow-servants, but
the firm conviction that she has only to do well
to get on; added to which she wears in her heart
the very best preservative against doing badly, the
talisman of the love and affection of the family
amongst whom she has been reared.</p>

<p>Each cottage is called at Ilford after the name
of a flower&mdash;Hawthorn, Rose, Forget-me-not,
Sweetbrier, and so on; and as far as possible the
hats and cloaks for Sunday and holiday-wear
are identified, each with its Home; so that the
groups belonging to the various Cottages may be
distinguished in church by the differing colour of
the hat or style of the cape.</p>

<p>A large laundry is attached to the cottages.
Here the girls learn laundry-work, from the clean
washing and ironing of a coarse towel to the careful
goffering and ironing of a lady's ruffle or a
gentleman's shirt. They all take their turn in
every department of the work, not doing a set
piece and then leaving it because the task is done,
but taking an interest in the part assigned to them,
and each one vying with the other in quickness
and thoroughness. The pride with which they
exhibited their ironing shewed plainly that it was
no forced task, but a labour of genuine pleasure.
Bright pleasant-spoken women superintend this
part of the Home, inculcating that 'everything
that is worth doing at all is worth doing well,'
and seeing that nothing is left till it is finished.
Although it was the dinner-hour, several of the
girls were still busy at the tables.</p>

<p>'It won't take you five minutes to finish that
shirt, Lucy,' we heard one of the women say to a
rosy-cheeked girl; 'and it would be a pity to leave
it; the starch will get so dry.' The girl answered
with a smile, and went on ironing cheerfully,
quite as anxious that her work should look nice
as the Mother was for her. Such training as this
cannot fail in its desired effect; and girls taught
thus early to take an interest in the labour of their
hands, cannot fail to do honour to the Home they
have been reared in, and the kind Mother, whose
affections they hope to retain to the end of life.</p>

<p>A girl who had been thus trained for two or
three years waited on us at lunch at the governor's
table. She is about thirteen, and not very big for
her age; but she managed not only to supply us
with all we required in a handy way, but to carry
up to the nursery the babies' dinner. Her movements
were quiet, her manners dignified and self-contained,
and she kept an eager watch on us, to
observe if we had all we needed. She was evidently
intent on doing her best, and was ambitious
enough to even try and divine if anything was
missing. We were informed when this girl left
the room that she had been in the Home some
time, that she had a fearful temper, but that great
hopes were entertained of her turning out at sixteen
a good useful servant.</p>

<p>We were all the more impressed with this specimen
of the results of the Home training system, as
we had only a short while since had in our house
a pattern girl from one of the workhouse schools.
She was sent to us as <i>quite</i> fit to enter service.
She was fourteen, a year older than the Ilford
little maid, and had been brought up from a baby
in the Union. She could read and write perhaps
better than most young ladies of her age; she knew
a smattering of geography, a jumble of history and
poetry, but such an amount of bad language and
viciousness that we were horrified at her knowledge.
Not one simple piece of household work did she
know anything about or cared to learn to do. She
was stolid and indifferent if shewn how to clean,
insolent if reproved for a fault, and not to be
trusted either in what she said or in what she did.
She had no standard of morals; stared absently, as
if one were addressing her in an unknown tongue,
if spoken to about trying to do her best to please
her mistress; and when waiting at table or performing
personal service, merely acted like a
machine; and yet she was naturally a much
cleverer girl than the Ilford child; and if she had
been subjected to the refining and humanising
effects of Home surroundings, might have developed
into a thoroughly useful maid.</p>

<p>Dr Bernardo entreats all who can to join him in
carrying on the work he has begun of rescuing
vagrant girls from destruction. Like many institutions
dependent on precarious contributions, it is
sadly in need of funds, and will gratefully receive
presents either in linen, simple stuffs for girls'
frocks, or in money; and we can answer for it, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">{436}</a></span>
all those who are interested in the Home and
would like to see it, will be kindly greeted by the
governor if they will take the trouble to visit
the pretty little Village at Ilford.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS" id="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS">THE LAST OF THE HADDONS.</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>CHAPTER XXXII.&mdash;BENT, BUT NOT BROKEN.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">An</span> hour later I slipped noiselessly in at the
cottage door, which stood hospitably open for me,
passed the parlour, where I could hear Mrs Tipper
and Lilian talking together, and stole up to my
own room. Gusts of wind and rain were beating
in at the open window. I afterwards heard that a
terrible storm had swept over the country that
night, laying waste the crops and spoiling the
harvest in all directions; <i>I</i> only knew of the storm
which had devastated my hopes. I imagined that
I had myself sufficiently under control to venture
to return&mdash;but alas! Another bitter struggle,
another wrestle with my weaker self, amidst wild
prayers for help&mdash;for death.</p>

<p>Then I was on my feet again, telling myself, in
a pitiable would-be jaunty strain: 'No; you will
never slip out of your misery in <i>that</i> way, Mary
Haddon, and it is folly to hope it. You are not
the kind of person, you know. You could not die
of a broken heart if you were to try. Your vocation
may be to suffer, but you will not die under it&mdash;certainly
not without a long preliminary struggle
to live. You are not made of the material which
fades gracefully away under pressure; and yesterday
you would have affirmed that you did not
wish to be made of it. You have always scouted
the idea of being at the mercy of circumstances;
you have been a little hard upon those who succumbed
under trial&mdash;in your inmost heart, you
know that you have not had much patience with
weakness; and now has come the opportunity for
proving your superiority to ordinary mortals.'</p>

<p>Then my mood changed. I dragged myself
towards the dressing-glass, thrust the damp hair
from my brow, and stared at my face with miserable
mocking eyes, as I reviled it for its want of
loveliness, and taunted myself with not being able
to keep a good man's love. Then I fell to weeping
and pleading again; and thank God, it was this
time for help to <i>live</i>. Alas, would the victory <i>ever</i>
come? Do others find as much difficulty as I did
in overcoming? Have others as much cause to feel
humble in the hour of victory as I had? I know
that it is all very pitiful to look back upon; though
the consciousness of my weakness under trial did
me great service afterwards. Weak and faint, but
thank God, not worsted, I at length rose from
my knees, bathed my face and hands, and after
a while had my feelings sufficiently under control
to think over the best way of doing what it was
my resolute purpose to do. My power of self-command
was very soon put to the test. I was
conscious of another sound besides that of the
sighing and sobbing of the wind, which like a
tired child who has spent its passion, was sinking
to rest again. Some one was tapping rather
loudly at the door.</p>

<p>Alas! how weak I still was. How could I meet
Lilian's eyes? Not yet, I dared not. But whilst
I stood with my hands pressed against my throbbing
heart gazing at the door, I recognised Becky's
voice. What a reprieve! I hastened to admit
her, and then locked the door again.</p>

<p>'If you please, Miss, Mrs Tipper was afraid you
was out in all this storm, and'&mdash;&mdash; She stopped;
looked at me for a moment with dilating eyes,
and then her tears began to flow. 'O Miss
Haddon, dear, are you ill? What's the matter?'</p>

<p>'You must not cry, and you must not speak so
loud, Becky.'</p>

<p>She saw that I waited until she had ceased, and
hastily rubbed the tears out of her eyes.</p>

<p>Then in a low quiet voice, I said: 'A great
trial has to be gone through, Becky. It <i>must</i> be
borne, and I think you can help me to bear it.'</p>

<p>'I knowed it was coming&mdash;I knowed it!' said
Becky, under her breath.</p>

<p>'What did you know was coming?'</p>

<p>She appeared for a moment to be searching in
her mind for the best way of telling me, and at
the same time expressing her sympathy; then
with lowered eyes replied: 'I loved Tom&mdash;I
always shall love him&mdash;and he can't love me.'</p>

<p>She knew then! Probably every one but myself
had seen it!</p>

<p>'In that case, you know that such things are
not to be talked about, Becky.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Miss; only'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'I know that it was your regard for me which
made you mention it. But we need all our
strength just now&mdash;you as well as I&mdash;and we must
not think or speak of anything that will weaken
it. I want your help, and to help me you must be
cool and quiet and strong. Will you try to be
that?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I will&mdash;I will indeed, dear Miss Haddon;'
eagerly adding: 'What can I do?'</p>

<p>I stood pressing my two hands upon my temples
in anxious thought a few moments, then asked:
'Do I look unlike my usual self, Becky&mdash;ill?
Tell me exactly how I look to you?' thinking of
the effect which the first sight of me had had upon
her!</p>

<p>'Yes; you look terrible white, and wild, and
trembling; and there's great black rims round
your eyes,' gravely and straightforwardly replied
Becky.</p>

<p>'As though I had been frightened by the storm.
There has been a storm; hasn't there?'</p>

<p>'Yes; there's been a terrible storm, Miss;
but'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Go on, Becky.'</p>

<p>'You're not the sort to look like that about a
storm.'</p>

<p>'I see.'</p>

<p>If that was Becky's opinion, the storm would
not do for Lilian and Mrs Tipper, and the alteration
in my appearance must be accounted for
in some other way. I was seeking about in my
mind for a way out of the difficulty, when Becky
unconsciously helped me with the exclamation:</p>

<p>'O Miss Haddon, dear, what have you done to
your hand?'</p>

<p>Looking down, I saw that there was a slight
wound in it&mdash;made I suppose when I fell, by a
nail or sharp stone&mdash;and that it had been bleeding
somewhat freely.</p>

<p>'Nothing to hurt, Becky,' I murmured; 'but it
will serve my purpose. Give me a handkerchief&mdash;quick!
and now another!'</p>

<p>She understood me; and when Lilian presently
came running up, she found appearances sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">{437}</a></span>
sanguinary&mdash;quite enough so, to account
for my looking strange and unlike my usual self.</p>

<p>'Dear Mary, what is it? Oh, how have you
hurt yourself?'</p>

<p>It was really a very superficial wound; but of
course I did not explain that; making a little
demonstration about the wrapping up with Becky's
assistance.</p>

<p>'It has made you look quite ill, dear!' went on
Lilian, kneeling down by my side. 'Let <i>me</i> tie
that, Becky.'</p>

<p>But Becky would not yield an inch until I had
given her a little look of reminder, and then did
so very reluctantly.</p>

<p>'And your clothes are quite wet, darling!' ejaculated
Lilian. 'You must have been out in all that
storm. Fearful, wasn't it? Could not you find
any shelter?'</p>

<p>'No; it had to be borne as best it might,' I
grimly replied; though I called myself to order at
once; a startled look in Lilian's eyes shewing me
that I could not talk about storms with impunity
as yet.</p>

<p>Then there was dear little Mrs Tipper hurrying
in with a concerned face to inquire what had
happened, and recommending all sorts of remedies
for my hand. Did I not think it better to send
Becky into the village for Mr Stone the surgeon?
Was I <i>quite</i> sure it did not require being strapped
up? Had I looked to see if there was anything
in the wound? &amp;c.</p>

<p>But I had my hand well muffled up; and
assured them, with more truth than they suspected,
that it really was not a very serious cut. 'Only I
think I will say good-night, and take off these wet
things at once, if you will excuse my not coming
down again,' I added, with a feverish longing to
be alone.</p>

<p>I had nevertheless to submit to mulled wine
and a great deal of comforting and petting. And
Lilian entreated to be allowed to remain with me
during the night. 'Dear Mary, do let me stay;
I feel sure that you are not so well as you think
you are.'</p>

<p>But I sent her off with a jest; and my first
difficulty was overcome. Two hours later, when
she had made sure that the others were at rest,
Becky stole into my room.</p>

<p>'I will lie on the floor, and I won't speak a
word; but don't send me away, please don't send
me away,' she whispered.</p>

<p>I was obliged to make the faithful girl share my
bed, for I could not prevail upon her to leave me.
Probably her presence was some little help to me
in the way of preventing any indulgence of sentiment,
had I been inclined to yield to it again.
When morning came, cool and fresh and sunny
after the storm, I was myself again; not my looks&mdash;the
effects of the storm which had passed over
<i>me</i> were not to be so easily effaced&mdash;but I was
nerved in spirit for what was to come. In the
early morning&mdash;so early that Becky had barely
time to slip away&mdash;came Lilian in her white
wrapper; and then I noticed how fragile she had
become. My darling, had I been even for a
moment so unjust as to doubt you, I could have
doubted you no longer! She was full of loving
sympathy about my hand.</p>

<p>'Dear Mary, I could not sleep for thinking of
you. Even now you do not look quite yourself.'</p>

<p>'Nevertheless, I am myself.'</p>

<p>She nestled closer to me, looking anxiously and
doubtfully up into my face. How thankful I
should have been just at that moment if love
were as blind as it is sometimes depicted as being!</p>

<p>'No; not quite your old self. Say&mdash;do say
that you love me, Mary.'</p>

<p>'Is it necessary to say it, Lilian?'</p>

<p>'Yes;' feverishly.</p>

<p>'Then I love you, child.'</p>

<p>'And&mdash;and say that you believe my love for
you is true&mdash;say it!'</p>

<p>'I <i>know</i> that your love for me is true, my
sister.'</p>

<p>Once more she clung to me trembling in her
deep emotion; but silently this time, and believing
that she was asking for strength to go on, I waited
until she was able to do so. Although I knew
now that she loved Philip&mdash;it was as plain to me
as that he loved her&mdash;I thought it better to let her
herself lead up to what she wanted to say. It
would comfort her by-and-by to remember she
had been able to say it. Presently she looked up
into my face, a holy light in the sweet eyes as they
steadily met mine.</p>

<p>'Mary, you have not told me when your
wedding is to take place. Recollect, you must
give me at least a week's notice for my dress. I
do not choose you to have a shabby bride's-maid.
No, indeed; I mean every one to see that&mdash;she
loves you. Is the time fixed?'</p>

<p>'Philip wished me to decide last night, and&mdash;something
was said about next week, dearie.'</p>

<p>'I am glad it is settled, Mary;' with grave
earnestness, her eyes still fixed upon mine.</p>

<p>'But&mdash;I am afraid it will shock you very much
to hear it&mdash;someway, I do not care to think about
it.'</p>

<p>She grew whiter, clinging closer to me as she
echoed: 'Not care to think about it!&mdash;your
marriage?'</p>

<p>I steadied myself. One weak word&mdash;a look&mdash;and
all would be in vain.</p>

<p>'It does seem a little strange even to myself.
But to confess the truth' (I could hardly keep
back a bitter smile at the thought of the truth
helping me <i>so</i>), 'I had scarcely promised Philip
an hour, before I began to think I would put it
off.'</p>

<p>'Why?' she murmured&mdash;'why?'</p>

<p>'It is so difficult to explain the workings of
one's own mind. I am not sure whether marriage
is my vocation. I begin almost to fancy that I
must have been intended for an old maid. Would
it shock you very much if I were to be one after
all?'</p>

<p>'You!&mdash;an old maid? How could that be?
You are jesting of course.'</p>

<p>'I am not so sure.&mdash;But run away and dress,
child. If we are late for breakfast, auntie will
fancy that all sorts of dreadful things have happened
to us.'</p>

<p>She obeyed me, but was, I saw, puzzled, and even
a little frightened at my jesting. The only effect
of my first attempt had been to make her startled
and afraid. Her knowledge of me had not taught
her to expect that I should not know my own
mind upon so momentous a question as my
marriage. My task would be difficult indeed. At
breakfast she told Mrs Tipper that my marriage
was to take place the following week.</p>

<p>'Next week, dear?' said the thoughtful little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">{438}</a></span>
lady, looking from one to the other of us in a
nervous startled way, adding rather confusedly: 'I
did not expect&mdash;that is, I thought there would be
more time for&mdash;preparations, you know.'</p>

<p>'I believe it is all Mary's fault; and that she
gave us so short a notice on purpose to escape a
fuss, as she calls it, auntie. But she will not
escape any the more for that, will she? A great
deal may be done in a week.'</p>

<p>'Of course we shall do the very best we can do
in the time, dear,' returned the little lady, looking
the least self-possessed of the three of us, as she
went on to ask me in a trembling voice which
day in the week was fixed upon.</p>

<p>I said something about its not being decided
yet, and tried to force the conversation into other
channels. But Lilian would talk about nothing
but the wedding and the preparations to be made
for it. Her forced gaiety might have deceived me,
had I not known.</p>

<p>'You will not require to buy much, auntie; the
gray moire and white lace shawl, which you only
wore once at the Warmans' <i>fête</i>, will do beautifully
with a new bonnet. But I of course must
be new from head to foot&mdash;white and blue&mdash;I suppose.
The best plan will be to write to Miss
Jefferies and give her a <i>carte blanche</i> to send
everything that is right; for we do not mind a
little extra expense for such an occasion; do we,
auntie?'</p>

<p>'No, dear, no; of course not. But you have
not asked what Mary has chosen.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that will be white of course.&mdash;When is
your dress coming down, Mary? I must see that
it is becomingly made; you know you are so careless
about such matters.'</p>

<p>I made some remark to the effect that wedding
dresses and wedding paraphernalia in general did
not sufficiently interest me to seem worth the time
and trouble they cost.</p>

<p>But Lilian was not to be repressed, returning
again and again to the one topic.</p>

<p>'And you must not forget that you promised to
let auntie and me take the management of Hill
Side during your absence, and see that all your
plans are being properly carried out. Nancy is to
go there at once, I suppose? Philip says that the
oak furniture for the library will not be ready
for a couple of months, on account of the firm
having so many orders for the pattern you chose.
And, recollect, Mary, I am to have the pleasure
of choosing <i>everything</i> for your own little cosy; I
know your taste so well that I am sure I shall
please you, and you are not to see it until it is
finished.'</p>

<p>All I could do was to try to give them the
impression, without saying so much in words,
that I was not so much interested in the question
as might have been expected. I saw that it would
not do to venture far, with Mrs Tipper's eyes
turned so watchfully and anxiously upon me.</p>

<p>My hardest trial was the unexpected arrival of
Philip soon after breakfast was over. Whether he
had come down only to fetch the papers, or whether
it was in consequence of what had passed between
himself and Robert Wentworth, I know not, but
he availed himself of the opportunity to tell Mrs
Tipper that I had consented that our marriage
should take place the following week.</p>

<p>At his first words I took the precaution of
seating myself at the piano with my back towards
them, running the fingers of my one hand over
the notes, with a demonstration of trying the air
of a new song which he had added to our collection.
Then with my fingers on the keys, I stopped
a moment&mdash;quite naturally, I flattered myself&mdash;to
throw him a few words over my shoulder.</p>

<p>'The idea of your taking my words so literally
as all that!'</p>

<p>'I not only took your words literally, but mean
to make you keep them literally.'</p>

<p>'Oh, nonsense!'</p>

<p>Ah Philip, how surprised you were, as indeed
you well might be, at my assumption of flightiness!
How more than surprised you were afterwards,
when I placed every obstacle I could think of in
the way to prevent our being alone together; and
how honestly you tried to act the part of a lover
in the presence of Mrs Tipper and Lilian, insisting
upon my keeping my word, and refusing to accept
any excuses for delay, Lilian as honestly taking
your side.</p>

<p>Fortunately, my maimed hand, which I kept in
a sling and made the most of, sufficed to account
for my altered appearance. But for that and my
bearing towards Lilian, Philip might have suspected.
Then he found me so entirely free from
anything like pique or anger towards himself, that
he could not imagine the change he observed to
be occasioned by any fault of his own. I had
indeed nothing to dissemble in the way of anger.
In my moments of deepest misery, it was given
me to see that there had been no intended disloyalty
to me. Philip's love for Lilian and her
love for him were simply the natural consequence
of two so well fitted for each other being thrown
together intimately as they had been. I am
writing from a distance of time, and of course in
a calmer frame of mind than I was in at the
moment of the trial; but I know that my thoughts
all tended to exonerate them from the first.</p>

<p>None knew better than did I how completely
free Lilian was from anything in the way of trying
to attract, even as much as girls may honestly do.
Knowing what I did&mdash;reading both their hearts&mdash;it
was very precious to me to see their truth and
fealty to the right. I knew that if they once perceived
my suffering, nothing would induce them to
accept happiness that way. I <i>must</i> keep my nerves
steady! As much as I was able to compass that
first day was to puzzle them all; but even that
was a little step&mdash;it was something that they could
see the change without discovering the cause.
Quite enough to begin with.</p>

<h2><a name="TORPEDOES_AND_INFERNAL_MACHINES" id="TORPEDOES_AND_INFERNAL_MACHINES">TORPEDOES AND INFERNAL MACHINES.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Easter Monday last, when several thousands of
persons were holiday-making in a public garden
out north-westward of London, a loud bang
startled the inmates of houses many miles from
the spot in all directions&mdash;louder than any discharge
of artillery, and comparable to a blowing-up
on a tremendous scale. It proved on investigation
to be due to the explosion of a cylinder no more
than twenty-five inches in length by two inches in
diameter, filled with one or other of those destructive
compositions which chemistry has lately presented
to us, and to which have been given the
mysterious names of dynamite, lithofracteur, gun-cotton,
nitro-glycerine, &amp;c. How such a diabolical
sausage got into such a place at such a time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">{439}</a></span>
what the police authorities have had to say about
it, we need not detail here; but the subject sets
people thinking ugly thoughts about Torpedoes
and Infernal Machines.</p>

<p>The French have had much to do with (so-called)
infernal machines, which, under various
forms, have been employed to assassinate successive
sovereigns, but happily failed in the wicked
attempt, though not without inflicting injuries on
onlookers. In 1804, when Napoleon thought that
he had England pretty nearly in his grasp, a <i>catamaran</i>
expedition was fitted out by the English to
act against him. This catamaran was an oblong
water-proof box lined with lead; it contained fifteen
hundred pounds of gunpowder, various inflammable
substances, clockwork to produce an explosion at
a given moment, and ballast to steady it. Being
towed towards an enemy's ship and left for the
tide to float it onward, it would cling to the ship
by means of grappling-irons buoyed up with cork;
and in a given number of minutes the clockwork
acting on a trigger would explode the combustibles.
Such at least was the theory; but the chances of
failure were found to be too numerous and varied
in practice. Some years after this, Colonel Colt,
the inventor of the celebrated revolver, devoted a
great deal of time to this subject of infernal
machines, making many combinations which were
useful as hints to later contrivers.</p>

<p>In 1809, when Lord Cochrane was engaged
against the French in the Bay of Biscay, he
employed a destroyer most formidable in character.
He filled a number of empty puncheons
with about fifty thousand pounds of powder; on
the tops of these puncheons were placed three
hundred and fifty explosive shells, with fuses,
and upwards of two thousand hand grenades
among and between them. The whole were
bound and jammed together with cables, wedges,
and sand, on board a small vessel called the
<i>Devastator</i>. A fifteen minutes' time-fuse being
ignited, the crew (Cochrane himself, a lieutenant,
and four seamen) rowed away quickly in a boat.
The infernal monster did not produce quite the
kind of mischief intended; the explosion was one
of the most tremendous ever heard; but the
enemy's ships were rather too far away to be
materially damaged, while Cochrane lost some of
his gallant little crew by over-fatigue and drowning
by tumultuous waves.</p>

<p>During the short war between England and the
United States in 1812-13, many submarine boats
were suggested and partially tried, but with no
great result.</p>

<p>The Crimean War (1854-56) brought to the Admiralty
a deluge of inventors and projectors, each
armed with some new scheme of a 'diabolical'
kind. The Earl of Dundonald (the Lord Cochrane
of 1809) sounded the government concerning
a plan which he had matured long before;
but there was hesitation in the matter; and the
public learned little more than that the scheme
related to a kind of fire-ship. Captain Warner's
'long range' was another crotchet, by which an
enemy's vessel was to be destroyed at an immense
distance by <i>something</i> being hurled against it; this
something, whatever it may have been, did not
find favour with the government. Then there
was a talk also about Captain Disney's war-projectile,
consisting of a metal cylinder having a
bursting charge at one end, and at the other a
highly combustible liquid; the liquid, when exposed
to the air, set fire to almost everything with
which it came in contact. This pleasant kind of
plaything was to be propelled against ships, buildings,
or masses of troops. Captain Disney had
another mode of employing what he frankly called
his 'infernal fluid,' which would 'cause blindness
for several hours to all troops coming within a
quarter of a mile of it.' The real nature of the
liquid was his peculiar secret, which, so far as we
are aware, the government did not think proper
to purchase.</p>

<p>While discoverers and inventors were directing
their attention to these intentionally destructive
contrivances, the principal governments were cautiously
testing some of them as opportunity offered.
The Russians studded the Baltic with submerged
torpedoes in 1854-55; iron cases containing combustibles,
sulphuric acid, and chlorate of potash,
so placed that a sudden concussion would make
the whole explode. Very few British ships were
really hit by them; but a good deal of uneasiness
was felt by the crews of Admiral Sir Charles
Napier's fleet, who would much rather have
encountered an open enemy than a concealed submarine
foe, the whereabouts of which could not
be determined beforehand. In 1866 the Austrians
in their brief war with Italy used torpedoes in
which gun-cotton was fired off by an electric
current. During the American Civil War, 1861
to 1865, nearly forty vessels were destroyed by
torpedoes. (We may here mention that this
name, first given to these contrivances by the
Americans, was derived from one designation of
the torpedo or electrical fish.) Three-fourths of
the destruction was wrought by the Confederates
against Federal vessels, but the remainder blew
up or disabled the Confederates' own ships. The
torpedoes employed were of various kinds and
sizes, some exploding by mechanical concussion,
some by chemical action, some by electric discharge.
One of them was a complete submarine
boat, which could be lowered to several feet below
the surface of the water, and there propelled with
hand-paddles at the rate of four miles an hour, by
men shut up in a water-tight compartment, and
provided with half an hour's compressed fresh
air. This submarine boat dragged a floating torpedo,
allowed it to come under the bottom of an
enemy's ship, paddled away to a safe distance, and
then fired the torpedo by an electric fuse. Such
at least was the theory; but it proved to be a
case of the engineer 'hoist by his own petard;'
for although the torpedo really did destroy a
Federal ship, the submarine boat and its crew
were never afterwards seen or heard of.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Some of the contrivances to which naval
engineers are directing their attention are called
<i>outrigger torpedoes</i>. A small swift steamer has an
outrigger or pole projecting twenty or twenty-five
feet from one side; a torpedo case is fastened to
the outer end of the pole, and a concussion-fuse
is fitted to it, or an electric-wire extends along
the pole. When the steamer has cautiously and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">{440}</a></span>
silently brought the torpedo (which may be
either a little above or a little below the surface
of the water) under the bottom of an enemy's
ship, the composition within it is fired by the
fuse or current, and the explosion left to do its
destructive work. It is supposed and intended
that the distance of twenty or twenty-five feet between
the steamer and the torpedo will keep the
former free from peril. Some torpedoes are self-explosive
on touching the enemy's ship. One
variety is a hollow iron cone, kept at a certain depth
under water by a mooring chain; the cone contains
from one to three hundred pounds of powder;
above this is an air-space to give buoyancy, over
this a small apparatus of chemicals, and at the top
of all a projecting rod. If the bottom or lower
part of the hull of a passing ship happens to strike
against this rod, a kind of trigger explodes the
chemicals and then the powder&mdash;with what result
the evil fates are left to determine. Another kind,
not self-explosive, is ignited from the shore. The
torpedo-cone is moored as in the former case, and
electric wires extend from it to a battery on shore.
When an enemy's ship is seen to be passing just
over the torpedo, a shock is sent from shore, and
the demon of mischief explodes. A self-exploding
torpedo has the disadvantage of destroying one's
own ships occasionally, by a mishap; while the
others are with difficulty coaxed to explode just at
the desired instant.</p>

<p>Six or eight years ago, the public were a good
deal mystified about Captain Harvey's torpedo,
what it was and what it was intended to accomplish.
It was described as an oblong box, to be
towed beside a steamer by means of a long rope. It
was charged with a powerful explosive composition;
it had projecting levers at the top, a tube
containing a detonating compound, and a bolt that
could be pressed down upon the detonator by the
levers. Towed out to its place by a steamer of
great speed, it is brought close to the side of a
hostile ship, the tow-rope is then slightly slackened,
the torpedo sinks a little, and as the rope tightens
again, it comes with a violent blow against the
ship's bottom, exploding and making (theoretically
at anyrate) a big hole in the ship's hull: a short
process, but by no means a merry one. (The
English authorities are said to be manufacturing
Harvey's torpedoes at Woolwich Arsenal at the
time we write, June 1877.)</p>

<p>Rather more recently, Captain Ericsson's torpedo
attracted the attention of the American
government. It had one feature of a remarkable
character&mdash;a hempen cable utilised as a tube or
pipe by making the centre hollow. The torpedo,
a cylinder of light galvanised iron, was about ten
feet long by nineteen inches in diameter, and was
charged with nearly four hundred pounds of nitro-glycerine.
It was towed by a steamer, with a
tubular cable or rope half a mile long. When
brought into a desired position, the torpedo was
propelled swiftly in any direction by compressed
air driven through the tubular rope. The torpedo
could be wound in so as to be any less distance
than half a mile from the steamer. One rather
fails, however, to see how the commander of the
steamer is to send the explosive matter against an
enemy's ship exactly at the right time and in the
right direction.</p>

<p>The Whitehead or fish torpedo, one of the
kinds now being experimented upon by the English
government, appears to be a very elaborate
contrivance. It is a sort of submarine rocket,
a cigar-shaped iron case five or six yards long
by about half a yard in diameter at the thickest
part. At one end is a charge of three or four
hundred pounds of dynamite or of compressed
gun-cotton, with a pistol or trigger-detonator to
ignite it; then a pneumatic chamber for compressed
air, with an apparatus for maintaining the torpedo
at any predetermined depth below the surface
of the water; then an air-chamber, tested to a
thousand pounds on the square inch, and containing
an air-engine with compressed air; and lastly,
a double action screw propeller. So much for the
torpedo; but how to make it travel along and then
explode? It is either driven into the sea out of
an apparatus called an ejector, fitted in the bow
of a steamer built for the purpose, or it can be
launched from a special carriage placed on deck.
The arrangements can be so made that the torpedo
will travel along at any depth below the water
varying from one foot to thirty feet, for a horizontal
distance of a thousand yards, and with a
speed of seven miles an hour. A torpedo-vessel
called the <i>Lightning</i> has just been built by Messrs
Thorneycroft and Donaldson for the Admiralty, to
contain two or more of these torpedoes, and to eject
them one at a time against an enemy's ships. The
idea is, to steam to a distance of a few hundred
(less than a thousand) yards from the enemy, and
eject a torpedo, with its engine, screw, &amp;c. working,
in the right direction; the head of the missile, if it
dashes under water against an enemy's ship, will
explode, and burst a huge hole in the ship's
bottom. Or by another adjustment the explosion
can be timed to occur in a definite number of
minutes after the ejection. A missile of great cost
this will be, whether it hits the enemy or not;
seeing that the whole of it will be hurled to
fragments if it explodes at all; a cost, per missile,
of four or five hundred pounds sterling.</p>

<p>A school of torpedo-warfare has been established
at Portsmouth; and there can be little doubt that
foreign powers are doing the like. Alas for
humanity and civilisation! It is contended, however,
that all this <i>diablerie</i> will lessen slaughter,
by deterring armed ships from coming within torpedo-distance;
but a great naval war can alone
determine the matter.</p>

<p>As to infernal machines, contrivances planned
for some dastardly and nefarious purpose, an
incident about four years ago gave us a little
insight into them. A cargo of highly insured but
worthless goods was shipped at a French port in a
steamer, and in the midst of the cargo an infernal
machine, intended to explode, destroy the ship
and cargo, and earn the insurance money for the
miscreant conspirators. The machine was a sort
of chest, provided with explosive compound, an
exploding apparatus, train of clockwork, primed
cartridge, trigger or striking needle&mdash;the clockwork
being timed to produce the explosion in a
given number of days after leaving port. An
occurrence at Bremerhaven a year or so ago
afforded a further illustration of this application
of scientific discovery and mechanical invention
to purposes at once fraudulent and barbarous.
Whether any case is on record of the <i>coal-torpedo</i>
having been really applied to its Satanic purpose,
we do not know; but that such a thing exists is
certain. It is a hollow shell of iron, carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">{441}</a></span>
moulded from a lump of coal, and blacked to
look like coal; an irregular cube of a few inches
on each side, and filled with terrible combustibles
of the dynamite kind. What does this mean? It
means that a steamer laden with almost worthless
goods insured at a very high value has a coal-torpedo
purposely mixed with the coal in her
bunkers, ready to explode whenever thrown into
the furnace, or perhaps before! Another infamous
contrivance, darkly hinted at, is the <i>rat</i>-torpedo,
which, placed secretly in the hull of a
ship, will after a time explode, and burst a hole in
the ship's bottom. Specimens of these two kinds
have come into the hands of European and American
governments.</p>

<p>The Easter Monday torpedo in a place of public
amusement, whatever it may have meant, was only
one (the reader will perceive) among many forms of
cylindrical, cigar, cubic, and globular missiles, of
the 'Infernal Machine' character.</p>

<p class='tb_space'>In the war lately commenced between Russia
and Turkey, torpedoes are playing a notable
part. The Russians, having a weaker navy than
their antagonists, supplement the deficiency by
employing these subtle agents. One Turkish
war-vessel, guarding the passage of the Danube,
has unquestionably been blown to pieces by
Russian torpedoes, and its crew destroyed. The
Russians have shewn much daring in approaching
Turkish ships during the dark hours of night,
attaching torpedoes to the ships' bottoms, retiring
quietly and swiftly, and leaving the explosive
monsters to do their fell work. On the other hand,
torpedo-defence has been practised with some success
by the Turks&mdash;preventing the approach of
torpedo-vessels, or fishing up the torpedoes themselves
before they explode. Torpedo-tactics, in
the naval warfare of the future, will evidently
embrace the two parts of torpedo-attack and
torpedo-defence. Where is it all to end?</p>

blushing in the most furious and uncalled-for
manner. 'What <i>can</i> have put such a ridiculous
idea into your head?'</p>

<p>'Well' (sulkily), 'you are so afraid of vexing
him, for one thing.'</p>

<p>'Not a bit more afraid of him than I would be
of you or any other man, under the circumstances,'
declares Cissy with exemplary candour. 'But it
is not a pleasant thing at any time to injure a
favourite hunter; and the mare, for some reason
or other, is a special darling with Captain Halkett.
Indeed, it was only yesterday I heard him saying
he valued her more than any animal he had ever
had.'</p>

<p>'Given him by one of the fair sex, most likely,'
says the major with vicious intent.</p>

<p>'Very probably,' returns Cissy quietly, who
carries a very game little heart beneath her pretty
Irish skin, and would have died rather than
betray any undue emotion. Nevertheless, it must
be confessed her colour faintly wavers and fades
away a little, only to return with tenfold brilliance
as she sees Captain Halkett pass the stable
window.</p>

<p>'Here he is!' she cries hurriedly. 'Now, what
<i>shall</i> I do?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, if my advice is worth anything,' says
the major sententiously.</p>

<p>Captain Halkett coming slowly up the yard,
cigar in mouth as usual, and hands thrust deep
in the pockets of his shooting-coat, sees Cissy,
Major Blake&mdash;and the groom on his knees beside
the mare. He takes in the whole situation at a
glance. Throwing away his cigar, he turns to
Cissy, and says pleasantly: 'Good-morning, Miss
Mordaunt. Had a good day, I hope?'</p>

<p>'Yes; thanks&mdash;very&mdash;that is, <i>no</i>, not at all,' says
Cissy nervously. 'I am afraid you will be horribly
angry. But the fact is, as Major Blake and I were
coming quietly home&mdash;cantering through the Park
fields, at the last gap some sharp stone caught the
Baby's leg, and has hurt her, as you see. I&mdash;I am
so <i>very</i> sorry about it,' concludes Miss Mordaunt,
genuinely vexed for the mishap.</p>

<p>'Don't say that,' entreats Halkett gently; 'and
don't vex yourself. I would rather the mare was
dead, than that you tormented yourself about her.
Besides'&mdash;stooping to examine the injury&mdash;'from
what I can see it is only skin-deep, and won't
matter in a day or two; eh, Connor?'</p>

<p>'Yessir; only a scratch, sir. Right as ever in
a week, sir.'</p>

<p>These words carry balm to Miss Mordaunt's
breast; and presently the bandages being finally
adjusted, and the Baby consoled by an additional
feed, they leave the stables; and Blake considerately
diverging to the right, Miss Mordaunt and
Halkett go leisurely towards the house.</p>

<p>As they reach the stone steps leading to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">{442}</a></span>
Hall door, Cissy pauses. 'You are <i>sure</i> you
forgive me?' she asks sweetly.</p>

<p>'How can you speak to me like that!' says
Halkett, almost angry. 'Did you think I should
cut up rough with <i>you</i>? What an ill-tempered
brute you must consider me; you ought to know
me better by this time.'</p>

<p>'I have not known you for so very long,' says
Cissy smiling; then impulsively, while her colour
once more deepens: 'Why is that horse such a
favourite with you?&mdash;beyond all others, I mean.
Was it a present?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' says Halkett in a low voice.</p>

<p>'From a very dear friend?'</p>

<p>'Very dear; more than a <i>friend</i>.'</p>

<p>'From&mdash;a gentleman?'</p>

<p>'No. From a lady,' says Halkett shortly, and
turns away his head.</p>

<p>On the instant, the words the major had uttered
in the stables come back to Miss Mordaunt's mind,
and without further comment she sweeps past
Halkett into the house, and he sees her no more
until dinner-time.</p>

<p>When half-past seven chimes out, and the
solemn retainer of the House of Mordaunt announces
dinner as being served, both Major Blake
and Captain Halkett make a hard fight of it to
take Miss Cissy down; but Fate, in the person of
Sir Thomas Lobin, interferes, and balks them of
their prey. Halkett, however, may be said to
have the best of it, as he succeeds in seating himself
directly opposite his Irish divinity, and so can
watch the changes of her beloved face, and perhaps
edge in a word or two, addressed particularly to
her, during the repast. All this can be the more
readily accomplished, as he has been told off to a
young lady who, if not actually insane, is at all
events three parts silly, and so does not feel it
incumbent upon him to supply her with the
orthodox amount of small-talk.</p>

<p>Major Blake falling into line, finds himself presently
situated somewhat low down, with Mrs
Fairfax on one side of him, and Grace Elton, a
cousin of Cissy's, on the other. If it were not that
his thoughts are altogether centred on Miss Mordaunt,
he might have considered himself in luck,
as he is undoubtedly in very good quarters. Grace
Elton is as unaffected as she is charming, and
extremely pretty into the bargain. But the major
will neither acknowledge nor see anything beyond
the tip of Cissy's nose, as it shews itself provokingly
every now and then from behind the
epergne.</p>

<p>On a line with Sir Thomas, and the third from
him, sits Mrs Leyton the Indian widow, in a
ravishing costume of pearl and blue that speaks
alone of worth. She is looking wonderfully handsome
to-night, and has a bright adorable spot on
each cheek that is <i>not</i> born of rouge. She is
keeping her hand in by trying a little mild flirtation
with the vicar, who occupies her right, and is
making very pretty play; while his daughter&mdash;who
is almost too young for society&mdash;watching them
from the opposite side, finds her mind much exercised,
and wonders in her heart if Mrs Leyton is
<i>really</i> very fond of papa. Surely she <i>must</i> be; else
why does she raise her large soft dark eyes so
tenderly to his once in every three minutes precisely,
by the marble clock on the chimney-piece?</p>

<p>Aunt Isabel, at the head of the table, is radiant
as usual, and dispenses roast turkey and smiles
with equal alacrity. She is carving with even more
than her customary vigour and well-known proficiency,
while at the same time she is listening
to and adding a word here and there to every
topic under discussion. She is, however, particularly
attentive to Miss Lobin, who sits beside
her, and who is as deaf as a post; though no
trouble to any one except herself, poor lady, as she
seeks not for conversation, and as long as she gets
a bit of everything mentioned in the <i>menu</i>, is
perfectly content.</p>

<p>There are two or three stray men from the
neighbouring barracks scattered up and down; and
these, with the three Misses Brighton&mdash;who being
evidently not cut out by mother Nature for the
civil service, have been considered suitable to ask
to meet them&mdash;make up the party.</p>

<p>'Well, Cis, you had a pleasant day, I hope?' says
Uncle Charlie, presently addressing his favourite
niece.</p>

<p>'A delicious day, dear uncle; only we wound
up with a misfortune. I was stupid enough to hurt
Captain Halkett's horse on my way home through
the Park; though indeed I scarcely think it was
my fault. However, as it <i>was</i> to happen, we were
lucky in having it occur at the end, instead of the
beginning of our day, as we had our ride in spite
of it.'</p>

<p>As she makes this little speech, she never once
glances at Halkett (indeed she has taken no notice
of him since the commencement of dinner), and
purposely treats the whole thing as unworthy of
regret. Halkett, contrasting her pretty contrition
of the morning with this off-hand dismissal of the
matter, is, manlike, thoroughly mystified.</p>

<p>'I am sorry to hear of an accident,' says Uncle
Charlie, who holds all good animals dear to his
heart.&mdash;'Nothing serious, I hope, Frank?'</p>

<p>'A mere scratch,' returns Halkett carelessly.</p>

<p>'That is right. It could not have happened
through any great desire on the rider's part to
reach her home, as she delayed her return so long
we all imagined an elopement had taken place.
But there was no such excitement in store for us.&mdash;I
do think, as your guardian and uncle, Cis,
I have every right to know what you and the
major were talking of all that time.'</p>

<p>'Politics,' says the major lightly; 'we never talk
anything but politics.&mdash;Do we, Miss Mordaunt?'</p>

<p>Here Blake dodges to one side of the epergne,
that he may the more surely get a full view of
Miss Mordaunt's face.</p>

<p>'<i>Never</i>,' replies Cissy emphatically, dodging the
epergne in her turn; and then they both laugh.</p>

<p>Here Halkett mutters something under his
breath that is so far audible as to rouse the silly
young lady by his side into some kind of life.
She sighs and uplifts her head.</p>

<p>'Were you speaking to me?' she asks in a
somewhat startled tone.</p>

<p>'No&mdash;yes&mdash;was I?' stammers Halkett, rather
shocked. 'I <i>ought</i> to have been, of course; but I
have fallen so low as to allow dinner to engross
all my attention. Pray, forgive me. It comes
entirely of going down to dinner with a middle-aged
gourmet.'</p>

<p>'Dear me&mdash;I fancied you quite young,' responds
his companion with a simper; and lapses again
into silence after the effort.</p>

<p>'Politics!' says Uncle Charlie, going back to the
subject, after he has desired the butler to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">{443}</a></span>
several different dishes to Miss Lobin. 'How you
must have enjoyed yourselves&mdash;especially Cissy.
I never met any woman with such keen and comprehensive
views on all matters connected with
the state. It was only yesterday I asked her
opinion of Gladstone, and she told me she always
thought he was'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Now</i>&mdash;Uncle Charlie,' interrupts Miss Mordaunt
with such indignation, that the old gentleman,
though chuckling to himself, audibly refuses
all further information.</p>

<p>'May we not hear your opinion of Gladstone?'
demands Sir Thomas, who is an old beau, and
much addicted to Miss Mordaunt.</p>

<p>'Certainly not. And remember I distinctly forbid
you to ask Uncle Charlie any questions when
my back is turned; as he is capable of saying <i>anything</i>
once my eye is off him.'</p>

<p>'Your will is my law,' says the old beau with a
bow that would have reflected credit on a Chesterfield;
and shortly afterwards, at a signal from Aunt
Isabel, the ladies rising, leave the gentlemen to
their own devices.</p>

<p>On entering the drawing-room, Mrs Leyton
walking with the undulating graceful motion that
belongs to her, and that cannot be acquired, goes
straight to the fireplace, where she sinks into a
lounging-chair, leaving the opposite one for Aunt
Isabel, who almost instantly falls into a gentle
doze. Little Miss Millar, the vicar's daughter,
losing sight of her shyness in her desire to obtain
her object, seeks a resting-place that will enable
her still to keep a fascinated watch over Mrs
Leyton, the widow having cast a glamour over the
timid country maiden. The Misses Brighton and
Grace Elton keep up a continual chatter, and are
evidently enjoying themselves immensely; while
Miss Lobin taking the cosy corner of the sofa,
emulates her hostess, and letting her face lengthen
until it reaches a state of utter imbecility, sweetly
snoozes.</p>

<p>Cissy is standing in one of the windows, somewhat
apart; she gazes out upon the stilly night,
and softly cogitates. She cannot quite make up
her mind whether she has been most sinned
against or sinning; she cannot wholly approve
her conduct at dinner, and finds it impossible to
divest herself entirely of the idea that Halkett was
looking miserable the entire time. But all men
make a point of appearing injured when placed in
the wrong position, and of course he had not liked
her cross-examination of the morning. Yet again,
why should he <i>not</i> receive presents from women?
What right had she to question act or word of his?
No matter what thoughts and hopes she may have
encouraged in the secret recesses of her heart, she
feels now she has no certain data to go upon to
prove that Halkett cares for her beyond all others.
Somebody&mdash;who was it?&mdash;had said he was a flirt.
Well, one thing was positive&mdash;he should not flirt
with <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>Here Aunt Isabel, slowly rousing, sneezes, and
hems audibly, to let her friends know she has not
been sleeping.</p>

<p>'Cissy, child,' she says, 'you will be perished
over there. Come to the fire and warm yourself.'</p>

<p>'I <i>am</i> warm, thank you, and quite comfortable.'</p>

<p>'My love, I don't believe it' (with extreme mildness);
'it is freezing as hard as it can, and there is
always a draught near a window. Come here,
when I desire you.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I shall die near that blazing log.'</p>

<p>'And <i>I</i> shall die if you remain over there,' says
Aunt Isabel; and carries her point.</p>

<p>'Better I than you, Auntie,' says Miss Mordaunt,
and coming over, good-humouredly kneels
down beside her kinswoman.</p>

<p>'Cold hands&mdash;warm heart,' murmurs the old
lady, caressing the soft white fingers that lie upon
her lap.</p>

<p>'A troublesome possession,' remarks Mrs Leyton
with a lazy smile. 'No one is <i>really</i> happy in this
world except he or she who carries an empty
bosom.'</p>

<p>'Are <i>you</i> happy?' asks Miss Cissy innocently.</p>

<p>'Almost. The little worn-out article that beats
here'&mdash;laying her hand over the region of the
heart&mdash;'has pulsations hardly strong enough to
cause me any uneasiness. Now and then I feel a
faint pang&mdash;not often.'</p>

<p>'I would rather keep my heart, even at the
expense of my suffering,' says Cissy warmly. 'She
who cannot feel anguish, can know no perfect joy.
Without love, life is a mistake, an unutterably
stupid gift. That is how <i>I</i> think; but then I am
Irish, and therefore of course unreasonable.'</p>

<p>'O no,' says Mrs Leyton graciously. 'The Irish
are the most charming people in the world&mdash;so
light-hearted, so quick to sympathise. Though I
have been here only two days, and have asked no
questions, I knew you to be Irish before you told
me. Most of my friends come from your land;
even Captain Halkett is half Irish, his mother
being from Galway.'</p>

<p>'Yes?' says Cissy. She rather shrinks from
mention of Halkett's name, and remembers with a
slight pang how friendly have seemed his relations
with Mrs Leyton since her arrival. 'Have you
known Captain Halkett long?' she cannot help
asking.</p>

<p>'All my life. His father and mine were fast
friends; our childhood was spent together. Then
we separated'&mdash;with a sigh, that sounds ominous to
Cissy, but in reality is only born of past sorrow,
utterly unconnected with him in any way&mdash;'to
meet again after many years in India, and now&mdash;here.
One way or another, all through, Frank's
life has been mixed up with mine.'</p>

<p>Cissy bites her lip, and asks no more questions;
but Mrs Leyton notices the action of the white
teeth, and ponders.</p>

<p>'There is a great charm in Frank's manner, I
think?' she says interrogatively.</p>

<p>'Is there? Most men nowadays are charming,
as acquaintances,' replies Cissy carelessly. 'And
Captain Halkett is too universal a favourite to be
altogether charming to <i>one</i>.'</p>

<p>'Poor Frank!' laughs the widow lightly. 'He is
unfortunate; or at least has found some one who
cannot appreciate him. Then you mean to say
you would find it impossible to care for any man
who liked some other woman besides yourself?'</p>

<p>'Well, as you ask me the question, I confess I
would,' says Cissy, who is feeling irritated, she
scarcely knows why. 'I would divide honours
with no one, and I would be winner&mdash;or nothing.'</p>

<p>'Then the man you love must be civil to no one
else?'&mdash;with arched eyebrows indicative of surprise.</p>

<p>'Oh, "<i>civil</i>." Let him be as civil as he pleases.
If you were talking merely of civility, I altogether
misunderstood you. I only meant if I had a lover&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">{444}</a></span>
at the present moment I certainly have
not&mdash;I would wish to be first in his eyes. Let
him be <i>civil</i> to all the world, but let him love <i>me</i>.'</p>

<p>'Quite so; that is only fair, I think,' says the
widow, but she looks immensely amused; and
Cissy seeing her expression, feels her wrath rising.
'I quite thought&mdash;judging from appearances&mdash;that
you and Captain Halkett were very good friends,'
goes on Mrs Leyton unwisely, and regrets her
speech a moment later.</p>

<p>'I beg you will not judge <i>me</i> from appearances,'
says Miss Mordaunt haughtily. 'A woman of the
world as you are, Mrs Leyton, ought surely to
know that people for the most part do not always
feel everything they may look. And besides, you
must forgive me; but if there is one thing I have
a particular objection to, it is being watched and
commented upon.'</p>

<p>'You are right,' returns Mrs Leyton with suspicious
sweetness; 'I fear I have been very indiscreet;
for the future I will not <i>watch</i> you and
Captain Halkett.'</p>

<p>There is a covert meaning in this speech that
is absolutely maddening; but the entrance of the
gentlemen puts a stop to Miss Mordaunt's reply.
She withdraws slowly, and seats herself upon a
distant lounge, where she is immediately joined
by Major Blake.</p>

<p>'I hope you have missed me,' he says with a
tender glance, pushing aside her trailing skirts that
he may gain room for his huge person. 'I assure
you the time those men spent over their wine was
actionable; while I was tantalised by dreams of
fair women the entire two hours.'</p>

<p>'Two hours! What an exaggeration. Why, by
Aunt Isabel's watch, that was never known to lose
a minute, it was only half an hour.'</p>

<p>'What to me was two hours, to you was but a
fourth of the time. How cruel an interpretation
may be put upon your words! And I have been
buoying myself up with the hope while absent from
you, that when we <i>did</i> meet again, I should hear
something kind from your lips.'</p>

<p>'And so you shall,' says Miss Mordaunt, bestowing
upon him a radiant smile, just to let 'that
woman' see she is not pining for the recreant
Frank. But unfortunately for the success of the
thing, Mrs Leyton is looking the other way, and
does not see it at all, while Frank Halkett does.</p>

<p>'Must I confess to you? Well, then, my accurate
knowledge of the hour arose from my incessant
glances at the watch, to see if your delay in
coming was really as long as it appeared&mdash;to <i>me</i>.'</p>

<p>'If I thought you <i>meant</i> that'&mdash;begins Blake
hesitatingly, with a sudden gleam in his eyes
(what man but feels more valiant after dinner than
before?)&mdash;'if I really thought you meant it'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;"if you <i>really</i> thought I meant it"&mdash;what
would you do then? But no!' she cries
hastily, seeing she has gone rather far, and unwilling
to bring matters to a climax&mdash;'do not tell me;
I do not wish to know. My ignorance in this case
no doubt is blissful; I prefer to remain in it.&mdash;And
now to change the subject. Who is Mrs Leyton?
and what do you know about her? I am all curiosity
where she is concerned.'</p>

<p>'Do you like her?' asks Blake, merely as a precautionary
measure.</p>

<p>'I can't say I do&mdash;exactly,' replies the Irish girl
candidly. 'Now tell me where you first met her.'</p>

<p>'In India. Her husband was alive when I first
became acquainted with her. He lived tremendously
hard; but he was devoted to her, without
doubt, and she to him; and she took his death
awfully badly. Never saw a woman so cut up by
anything before; they generally take it pretty sensibly
after the first shock, but she didn't; and went
to a skeleton in less than three months.'</p>

<p>'She is not very thin now.'</p>

<p>'No. I suppose one can't keep on pining for
ever, and in course of time good food <i>will</i> cover
one's bones. But she felt it no end for months,
and was altogether down in her luck. You see he
got rather a horrible death, as his horse first threw
him, and then almost trampled him beyond recognition.'</p>

<p>'How dreadful!' murmurs Miss Mordaunt, with
a little shiver; and wonders how Mrs Leyton could
ever have smiled afterwards.</p>

<p>'Yes; wasn't it? She took it so much to heart,
that for years after she could not bear the sight of
a horse, though she had the best seat in the regiment&mdash;amongst
the women, I mean&mdash;and could not
be induced to take a ride. Before leaving India,
she sold, or gave away, every one of her horses.'</p>

<p>Here Cissy becomes intensely interested. 'To
whom did she give them?' she asks indifferently.</p>

<p>'I hardly know; I was up-country at the time,
but her most intimate friends, I suppose.&mdash;By-the-bye,
Halkett was an immense crony of hers.'</p>

<p>'Indeed?'</p>

<p>'Never out of the house,' says the major, thinking
it a good opportunity to improve his own
chances, though really only giving voice to what
had been the common report in that part of India
where the catastrophe had occurred. 'After Tom
Leyton's death, he would have married her like a
shot; but she would not hear of it. She is a very
handsome woman, you know, and tremendously
admired by some fellows, though for my part I
don't altogether see it.'</p>

<p>'Don't you? I think her wonderfully pretty.
Perhaps she will relent, and marry him now; who
knows? Certainly his constancy deserves some
reward. Was it Mrs Leyton gave him the mare?'</p>

<p>'Don't know, I'm sure. But think it very
likely, now you mention it, as he sets such
uncommon store by her.&mdash;How very well Mrs
Leyton is looking just now,' says the major, adjusting
his eyeglass with much care, and glancing significantly
at the other end of the room, where sits
the widow in earnest conversation with Frank
Halkett. Cissy follows the direction of his gaze,
but, conscious of his scrutiny, takes care that not
one muscle of her face betrays what she is really
feeling.</p>

<p>Yes, very well, very handsome looks Mrs Leyton,
as leaning gracefully back in her chair, with one
hand toying idly with the rings that cover her
fingers, she listens to Captain Halkett's conversation.
Now and then she raises large dreamy eyes&mdash;half
mirthful, half sympathetic&mdash;to his face, but
scarcely interrupts him. He is talking with much
earnestness&mdash;is apparently entirely engrossed by
his subject&mdash;and takes no heed of what is going on
around him. Presently he ceases, and evidently
seeks an answer from his beautiful companion.
She gives him one of her upward glances&mdash;all
sympathy this time&mdash;and says a few words; but
they are without doubt the right ones, as Halkett's
face brightens, and a smile overspreads it that
makes it positively handsome. At the moment he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">{445}</a></span>
raises her hand, and bending over it, seems to
examine her rings curiously. To Cissy the action
almost bespeaks a betrothal, and renders her half
indignant, wholly miserable. Nevertheless, turning
to Major Blake, she says with a bright brave smile:
'I think my idea was right, and even now he has
received his reward.'</p>

<p>'Looks uncommon like it,' says the major with
a sigh of relief.</p>

<h2><a name="NOTES_FROM_CHINA" id="NOTES_FROM_CHINA">NOTES FROM CHINA.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A medical</span> gentleman at one time resident in
China furnishes the following notes of interesting
incidents within his knowledge. Though roughly
put together, they may amuse our readers and be
relied on as true.</p>

<p>In the month of January 1869, at about half-past
seven <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, I was sitting at dinner in my
house in Swatow, when a sailor from the small gun-boat
at that time in Swatow Harbour came running
breathless and hatless, asking me to come down
without any delay to the hospital, which I had
built in the Chinese town on the side of the river
opposite my own house. This man said there were
thirteen sailors and the captain of the gun-boat
badly wounded by an unprovoked attack of the
Chinese. This looked serious indeed; so putting
up instruments, lint, &amp;c. I hastened down with
the sailor. On reaching the hospital, the unwounded
men of the gun-boat were still carrying
into the hospital their injured comrades. I never
saw a set of men so severely wounded without any
being fatally so. I set to work, and extracted
fifteen bullets from the men; but some were too
deeply imbedded to get at that night. One man
had one ear shot off, a second two fingers, a third
was hit in the eye, a fourth shot in the breast,
and I afterwards extracted the bullet at his back.
The captain of the gun-boat had on a very thick
shaggy pilot-coat, double on the breast; a bullet
had cut right across his chest; and on examination
I found the skin just raised where it had passed.
A very singular wound was that of a young
officer, whose two front teeth were knocked in by
a bullet, that then disappeared somewhere in his
palate. I never could find this bullet whilst he
was under my care; but it seemed not to have done
him much harm. He left Swatow; and I saw him
three or four years later, and he said the lead had
never appeared, and he had suffered no inconvenience
from it. I believe it must have worked
itself somewhere into the muscles at the back of
his neck.</p>

<p>The cause of this raid of the Chinese was this:
the captain of the gun-boat had merely taken out
twenty-five men to exercise by rowing one of his
boats up the river Han, on which Swatow is situated.
This river is very wide at the mouth, and
abounds in large creeks; on the banks of one of
the largest of these, next to Swatow, are built
three fortified walled-in villages, or what we should
call <i>towns</i>, from their large population. The inhabitants
of these towns were well known as
being particularly lawless, not having paid taxes
for many years, and setting the mandarins at defiance.
Seeing the foreigners (whom they detest)
rowing up the creek, 'the Braves' (as they call
themselves) rushed out in hundreds and fired into
the gun-boat from each side of the river; and were
it not for the nature of their guns, or as the Chinese
call them 'gingals,' which are old-fashioned and
of short range, none of the boat's crew would have
returned alive; as it was, fourteen men were well
riddled; and the boat, which I saw afterwards, had
as many holes in it as a colander. The sailors
rowed away for their lives, and escaped.</p>

<p>Our settlement, on hearing this story, was in
great and just alarm. These people detest the
foreigners; and having put to flight their supposed
enemies in a crippled state, it was very likely they
might follow this up by an attack on the settlers;
and had they only sufficient courage, their numbers
were so great, that our fate would have soon
been decided by pillage and murder. The British
consul, Mr Alabaster Challoner, saw the danger;
and being a man of decided character and
great energy, without any delay sent a merchant-ship
that was in the harbour under high steam-pressure
to Hong-kong to inform the Admiral of
what had happened. The reply was prompt and
satisfactory; for a few hours brought Admiral
Keppel, Lord Charles M. Scott (son of the Duke
of Buccleuch), two frigates, and seven gun-boats
into Swatow Harbour, to the great satisfaction of
the foreign settlers and of Mr Challoner. This
gentleman was a small delicate-looking man, whose
neck being a little crooked, made him hold his
head on one side; but such was his courage, determination,
and inflexible sense of justice, that the
stoutest Chinese officials trembled at his look; and
they all declared they would rather face a tiger
than meet the glare of 'His Excellency the Devil's'
eyes when displeased. The Admiral immediately
told off five hundred marines and blue-jackets,
fully armed and supplied with two small cannon,
to punish the offenders. The friendly natives of
Swatow averred loudly that these men were going
to certain destruction; that not one would return,
as the tribe in question was invincible; and most
of the foreign merchants were sufficiently alarmed
by these assertions to send all their most valuable
possessions on board the vessels in the harbour.
Fortunately the result was not what they dreaded.
On approaching the first town, the troops saw
'the Braves' in vast numbers on the walls, shouting,
waving flags, jumping up and down, and calling
on them to come on and be killed. The
tars replied by blowing open the gates with gunpowder,
and falling on the heroes, who instantly
gave way and fled precipitately. They then set fire
to the place, sparing all who did not resist. They
treated the other towns similarly, and returned
victorious. The excellent effect of this prompt
action was to produce a complete tranquillity in
the neighbourhood of Swatow, which has remained
undisturbed ever since (eight years), and a feeling
of security which never before existed; yet the
Admiral was reproved by the British government
at that time for having acted without 'home
orders!'</p>

<p class='tb_space'>In the winter of 1873 a very unseaworthy
merchant sailing-vessel (a Siamese), the <i>Tye Wat</i>,
set out from the north of China to Siam with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">{446}</a></span>
cargo of beancake, &amp;c. The weather became
excessively stormy, and at last the old vessel
actually went to pieces many miles from land in
the Gulf of Pe-che-le. The crew consisted of eight
Malays, who worked the ship; the captain, an
Englishman; and in addition was one Chinese
woman. They had no boats on board, no time to
make a raft or means of doing so; and as the
vessel was rapidly sinking, the wretched people
looked round in despair; when a hope of escape
struck one of them as his eye lighted on a very
large wooden water-tank which was on deck.
This tank was strongly made, about six feet long,
five feet across, and five feet high, with a large
hole at the top into which a man could squeeze,
and a tight-fitting cover. There was not a moment
to lose: a hole was bored in the bottom, to let out
what water it contained, then quickly plugged;
and all ten squeezed themselves in hurriedly, put
on the lid, and awaited their fate. In a quarter
of an hour after they were thus packed, the ship
sunk under them. They first whirled round, and
then floated off freely, and felt themselves rolling
and tossing about frightfully on a stormy sea.
The weather was intensely cold, so much so that
icicles had hung from the rigging of the sunken
ship the day before; and being so tightly packed,
perhaps it was fortunate the weather <i>was</i> so cold.
In their haste to save life, they had brought only
part of a ham which the captain had snatched
up, and a bottle of brandy; and thus these poor
creatures were tossed about from day to day,
hungry and thirsty, jostled like potatoes shaken in
a barrel; now and then, when they dared, letting
in a little air by raising the lid. Their situation
strongly reminds one of Gulliver in his box when
the eagle carried him out to sea from the land of
the Brobdingnags.</p>

<p>On the fifth day the Malays said they must kill
and eat the English captain; but the poor Chinese
woman (to the credit of her sex) vehemently
opposed them, and succeeded in saving him for
that day. On the sixth day the Malays said they
<i>must</i> eat her; but the captain in turn saved <i>her</i>
for that day. It is difficult to imagine a more
horrible situation than that of this poor Englishman
surrounded by eight starving men determined
to eat him, which they certainly would have done
had not an English vessel rescued them on the
seventh day. It happened thus: the captain of that
vessel sighted a large box tossing on the waters,
and at first never thought of minding it, only
supposing it part of some wreck, as the weather
was so bad; but as he looked, to his utter surprise
a head popped up through the hole in the centre,
and then vanished, to be followed by another
figure, making frantic gesticulations. With much
difficulty this strange box was got alongside,
hauled up, and its poor inmates dragged out to
light barely alive, and emaciated fearfully, finding
the man-hole easier to pass out of than to
get into; which was reversing the fable of the
weasel who got into the barn. The captain of the
rescuing vessel was a kind Englishman, and did
all in his power to restore his guests. They were
still in the Gulf of Pe-che-le; and did not reach the
port of Swatow sooner than six days, where a
doctor was called in to visit these liberated 'Jacks-in-a-box.'
He said they were a singular proof of
how much human beings can endure. All lived, and
recovered perfectly. Certainly they were all <i>young</i>
people. The Malays went home. The English
captain went to Singapore, and shewed himself
really grateful to the poor Chinese woman who
had saved him from the jaws of the Malays.</p>

A LIVELIHOOD.</a></h2>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Why</span>, sir, we never should wake of our own
accord, specially these dark mornings, if we hadn't
somebody to knock us up.'</p>

<p>The speaker was a worthy artisan whom I often
used to meet at a certain steam-boat pier on the
Thames; his after-breakfast labours appearing to
begin about the time I usually was in waiting for
the boat.</p>

<p>'You see, sir,' he continued in answer to a question
I had put to him&mdash;'you see, sir, there's about
sixty of us hereabouts down by the water-side;
and there's so much that depends upon the tide,
that we have to be called at all hours&mdash;sometimes
two o'clock in the morning, or three or four, just as
the case may be.'</p>

<p>'But who is it calls you?' I asked. 'A policeman,
I suppose?'</p>

<p>'No; not a policeman,' my companion answered;
'it would take up a deal too much of his time;
besides, fresh policemen are always coming on to
the beat, and we could not be bothered with constantly
having to shew and tell a new man the
way.'</p>

<p>'Well, it must be rather an awkward matter,' I
observed.</p>

<p>'No; it isn't. We each pay fourpence a week to
Phil Larkins; and he wakes us as regular as clockwork.'</p>

<p>'But if sixty people want to be called at all sorts
of irregular hours, how does the awakener manage
to know his duties?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, we chalk on our doors or shutters the time,
and that way he knows. Phil is to be depended
upon always. But he very nearly lost the work a
year ago, and it was a shame. Some fellow wanted
to step into his shoes, and morning after morning
went and altered the chalkings, so that we were
either called two hours before our time, or over-slept
ourselves, and so got into trouble. There was
no end of quarrels and misunderstandings till the
trick was found out. And I think the rascal who
did it deserved a ducking&mdash;only, you see Phil is
such a little fellow he couldn't give it him.'</p>

<p>'It was a dastardly trick!' I exclaimed with
indignation, bidding the man good-bye.</p>

<p>Another speaking acquaintance of mine was an
old man whose duty consisted in sweeping down
the steps which were submerged at high-tide, but
quite bare at low-water. I had often seen him at
work cleansing from mud and silt step by step as
the tide receded; and now it occurred to me that
from the nature of his occupation he, of all others,
must work at the most irregular hours. It was
a dull wintry morning, but the old man was
working cheerfully at his accustomed task, which,
as the water was getting low, was very nearly
completed. He was pale and thin, but had that
air of decent respectability which happily is often
seen in the very humblest classes.</p>

<p>I opened the conversation in true English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">{447}</a></span>
fashion by a remark on the weather, asking his
opinion as to the probability of rain.</p>

<p>'Snow more likely,' he answered laconically,
but quite civilly.</p>

<p>'I daresay you are right,' was my reply, 'for I
should think you are one of the weather-wise
people.'</p>

<p>'Ought to be, if there's anything learned in
being always twelve hours in the four-and-twenty
out of doors all seasons,' was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>'Rather hard work for you, my man,' I said
sympathisingly.</p>

<p>'I don't complain. There's lighter work to be
sure, but there's some that's a deal heavier; and
after being at it so many years, maybe it comes
easier to me than it would to another. I was only
fifty-five when I began, and now I'm seventy-three.'</p>

<p>'And is it necessary that you should work all
the six hours that the tide is ebbing?' I asked,
really desiring the information.</p>

<p>'Quite necessary,' he replied, descending a step,
and plying his broom vigorously as he spoke.
'Why, if I did not begin at the beginning and go
on regularly, the mud would harden, and I should
have to drag up buckets of water to wash the
steps with. And gentlefolks want nice clean steps
going to the boats.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you are glad when your work does
not happen to be in the dead of the night?' I
observed.</p>

<p>'I don't know that I care. It is the change in
the time that makes the variety in the work. And
sometimes on fine nights, when the stars are blinking
and winking, or the moon floating in the sky,
with the clouds rushing along as if every now and
then they were washing her face&mdash;I think things
and feel things as I don't at other times. I think
it is a mistake for people always to sleep of nights,
I do.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you depend on some one to call you
up at the turn of the tide?' I said inquiringly.</p>

<p>'No; I don't,' replied the old man, with a shake
of his head. 'I tried that at first, but it didn't
answer. I daresay Larkins might do it; but it was
before he took to the business of knocking at
doors; and the man I trusted to made mistakes or
else forgot, and didn't wake me right, and I very
nearly lost the place; and ever since I have trusted
to myself.'</p>

<p>'Then how do you manage?' I said.</p>

<p>'That is just what I don't know, except that it
seems to me it is managed for me. I only know
that if it is high-water in the deadest hour of the
night, I always do wake. It is just as if something
said: "Look alive; time's up;" and sure enough it
always is. I often wonder at it; but I have come
to think that wondering is of no more use than
wondering at the tides coming up so surely, and
the new moons shining just as they are expected,
and the stars all keeping their places so safely.
O sir, some folks, no doubt, are very learned, but
there's a deal more in the world than people can
ever make out.'</p>

<p>'Do you know, my friend, that you are speaking
the thoughts of one of the greatest of men?' I
exclaimed, reflecting on Hamlet's words to Horatio.</p>

<p>'Am I? What did he say?' was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>'He said,' I exclaimed, '"there are more things
in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our
philosophy."'</p>

<p>'Well, he was right, whoever he was,' exclaimed
the old man, with a sort of innocent satisfaction at
his own corroboration of a great man's words.
'And what's more, I think the world would be a
worse place than it is if we had nothing left to
wonder at.'</p>

<p>'I heartily agree with you,' was my reply.</p>

<p>'And there's more to wonder at than even the
stars and the tides,' continued the sweeper, 'and
that's the ways of men, the good and the bad
that's in the most of us. But then I do think we
river-side people see more than others, what with
the partings and meetings going on; and now and
again the dead bodies that come to shore, and sometimes
the miserable despairing people who would
drown themselves if they weren't hindered. Well,
it's these things that set me wondering and thinking,
and that make the working hours pass quickly,
especially at night.'</p>

<p>'You seem a bit of a philosopher,' I said admiringly.</p>

<p>'What's that?' cried the old man.</p>

<p>'It means lover of wisdom,' I replied; 'and he
is happy who can justly lay claim to the title.
My friend, we must have another talk another day.'</p>

<p>'Well, sir, you'll always find me here according
to the tide; leastways unless I am ill again, as I was
last year.'</p>

<p>'How was that?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Well, I don't quite know myself,' the old man
answered, 'for I don't remember much about it.
When they found the steps neglected, some of the
wharf people came to look after me, and then they
took me off to the hospital, where I was for a
matter of six weeks. You see, sir, since my poor
old missus died I am all alone, for my grandson
went to sea; his father is a soldier; and my
daughter has been in service these thirty years; so
I had no one to go for a doctor or give me a drink
of water.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that was very sad,' I exclaimed.</p>

<p>'Well, it was rather hard lines; but you see no
one knew how I was taken; and when they found
me, folks were mighty good to me, and they gave
me back my place when I got well; so I ought not
to complain.'</p>

<p>The boat by which I travel was now nearing the
pier, and I stepped on board, with a friendly nod
to the old man, reflecting with some sympathy on
the many such stories which doubtless, if we knew
them, would serve to swell</p>

<h2><a name="FROTH" id="FROTH">FROTH.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Children</span> sometimes ask, and men and women need
not be ashamed to ask, why is froth always white
or nearly white, whatever may be the colour of
the liquid underneath it? To answer the question,
we shall have to determine what froth really is
in itself, and how it is formed.</p>

<p>Take a filled ale-jug, or the well-known 'pewter'
of a tavern or public-house, and pour out gently
into a glass: scarcely any froth is produced. Pour
out the self-same liquor from the self-same vessel
in a stream several inches high, and you produce
a foaming 'head,' which to the eye seems to be
a substance quite different from ale or beer. Open
a bottle of lemonade or ginger-beer, of soda-water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">{448}</a></span>
or seltzer-water, and pour out the contents into
a glass; the formation of froth is so rapid and
abundant that the glass appears full when it
really contains but a small quantity of liquid.
Open a bottle of Bass's ale or of Guinness's stout;
the froth is still more opaque and pronounced.
Look at a cup of tea or coffee soon after the sugar
has been added; there will often be seen a small
covering of froth on the surface, which froth, if
not actually white, is much more so than the
liquid beneath. Watch the movements of the
paddle-wheels of a steamer; the water thrown
back from them is covered with foam of dazzling
whiteness, the intensity of the white increasing
with the rapidity of the wheel's motion.</p>

<p>In all these cases, and in multitudes of like
kind, the froth seems to result from agitation; a
quiescent liquid seldom presents symptoms of
this nature. But agitation alone would not do
it. Supposing it were possible for human beings
to live, or for pints of ale to exist, without <i>air</i>,
there would be no such thing as froth. In pouring
out ale or other liquid, the falling stream becomes
mingled with a portion of the atmospheric air
which surrounds us; and it also buries, as it were,
the air contained in the apparently empty glass:
the result is, a mixture of ale and air, instead of
ale only. Under ordinary circumstances, liquids
contain as much air as they are capable of
absorbing; the additional quantity is expelled.
But how? It cannot rise in a body to the surface,
but divides into minute spherical portions or air-bubbles,
which ascend to the top of the liquid
on account of their levity or comparative lightness.</p>

<p>This, however, is not all; if it were, the bubbles
would burst directly they come to the surface, and
froth would not have an opportunity of forming.
Cohesion comes into action, the cohesion between
the particles of every liquid. The bubbles of
air, as they rise from the body of the ale, beer, or
other liquid, are able to penetrate between the
particles; but when they arrive at the surface
they encounter a film of liquid cohesive enough
to restrain for a time their final escape into the
atmosphere. Froth consists of bubbles, each a
tiny globular portion of air, bounded on the
upper surface by an exceedingly thin film of
liquid; the bubbles retain this position and condition
until the struggle ends as a victory for one
of the belligerents. The ascensive power of the
air within the bubble overcomes the cohesive
power of the liquid film or covering, and 'the
bubble bursts'&mdash;our beverage loses its frothy
'head.' The length of time that elapses before the
air escapes by the bursting of the bubble depends
chiefly on the viscidity of the liquid. If we pour
ale into one vessel and water into another, from
equal heights, we shall find that the former will
present a frothy surface, the latter a more instantaneous
sparkling appearance; the power of retention
being greater in the former instance
than in the latter. In other words, ale having a
greater specific gravity than water, and also greater
viscidity, the bubble formed has a thicker coating,
and requires a longer time for its disrupture.
Taking the round of all the 'frothy headings,'
we find the same rule prevail. In the spray from
the paddle of a steamboat, in the froth on the
surface of beverages, in the sparkles on a cup of
tea, the air is in the first place entangled among
the particles of liquid, and thus forms bubbles in
the struggle to escape. Although carbonic acid
may, in regard to physical properties, be ranked
as a kind of air, the formation of froth in effervescing
liquids is slightly different.</p>

<p>But why is froth <i>white</i>? Porter, ale, tea, coffee,
champagne, water, differ very considerably in
colour; yet in all of these, when froth is produced
it is white. This appears to be due to the
reflection of the light from the outer surface of the
several bubbles. When the surface is thus broken
up, we have a cluster of little spheres, each of
which presents a reflection to the eye from some
part of its surface; and as there may be tens of
thousands of these in a very small space, the effects
become united, and are recognised as a whiteness.
It is simply an aggregation of small effects to
produce one more conspicuous. If the bubbles
are large, then fewer of them can be contained in
a given area; consequently the number of convex
reflecting surfaces is smaller, and the united effect
less brilliant&mdash;in other words, less white.</p>

<p>But it may still be asked by some of us, how is it
that the froth of a <i>reddish</i> liquid, such as beer, is
white? The phenomena of reflected light must
again be appealed to for the means of solving this
problem. The colour of a liquid (not its froth) is
determined by the transmitted light, not the reflected.
If liquor be contained in a transparent
glass vessel held between the eye and the light,
and we look <i>through</i> it, the eye receives the light
transmitted by the liquid, and deems the colour
of that light to be the colour of the liquid itself;
but if we pour the liquor into an open vessel, and
look obliquely at the surface, we shall find that
the colour does not deviate much from whiteness,
whatever the transmitted colour may be. The
liquid, whatever be its body colour, is when agitated
broken up into detached portions at its
surface by the formation of bubbles, and each
bubble reflects to the eye a portion of the
light which falls upon it. Consequently, if this
reflected light is nearly white in all cases, the
resulting assemblage of bubbles, generally known
as froth, must always appear white or nearly
white. We can easily understand the greater
yellowness of the froth on strong Dublin stout
than that on pale Burton ale; the more tenacious
liquor forms a thicker and consequently less clearly
reflecting bubble than that on the more limpid.</p>
